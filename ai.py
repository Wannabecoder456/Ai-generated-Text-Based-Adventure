and also, make it lore accurate from my book, after the players gets after it, go wild, and i mean it- ‚Ä¢ Prologue: A nurse, aware of an ancient prophecy, secretly swaps a newborn royal prince with a peasant boy born under mysterious circumstances, sending the true heir to the mines and setting the stage for unforeseen events.
‚Ä¢ Chapter 1: Zachor, the switched noble child, grows up in the brutal Mine of Slokia, enduring horrific abuse, witnessing his family's destruction, and developing a hardened resolve against a world that punishes weakness.
‚Ä¢ Chapter 2: During a devastating dragon attack on the mines, Zachor is flung into a mysterious, untouched jungle where he begins to navigate its strange, often peaceful, ecosystem while coming to terms with his isolated survival.
‚Ä¢ Chapter 3 (Verdant Hollow): Forced deeper into the jungle by its shifting paths, Zachor encounters wild animals, embracing a "psychotic", brutal fighting style born from his past trauma to survive its dangers and arriving at a mysterious scroll.
‚Ä¢ Chapter 4: The jungle relentlessly draws Zachor toward its heart, where he battles a tribe of cannibals, realizing he possesses a potent, wild side that allows him to conquer them, yet still struggles with his untamed magic.
‚Ä¢ Chapter 5 (Hollow Flames): Zachor is transported to a bizarre dimension where his "psychotic side" reveals himself as Hollow Flame, the Prophecy Energy trapped within him, and begins a brutal training regimen of endless running and death-revival cycles.
‚Ä¢ Chapter 6 (True Training): Under Hollow Flame's relentless instruction, Zachor endures countless deaths and revivals while fighting hordes of monsters, learning to strategize and exploit weaknesses, leading to him unleashing a devastating magical attack.
‚Ä¢ Chapter 7 (The Creature): Zachor faces a new threat of merging monsters and a powerful abomination that adapts to his fighting style, forcing him to strategically self-destruct repeatedly to defeat it, which finally transforms Hollow Flame's dimension into a lush, peaceful landscape.
‚Ä¢ Chapter 8 (Grass and Godhood): Hollow Flame reveals Zachor has accumulated 630 million monsters to fight, which manifest as a single colossal entity that vaporizes Zachor repeatedly until he learns to endure its poisonous breath and ultimately defeats it through a final strategic self-detonation.
‚Ä¢ Chapter 9 (The Center Stirs): Returning to the real jungle, Zachor is now exceptionally powerful and encounters Adrian and Lily, two adventurers, protecting them from adapted creatures while learning the jungle itself reacts to his presence.
‚Ä¢ Chapter 10 (Sister of Flame): Zachor, Adrian, and Lily arrive at the jungle's center, where Zachor is transported to a mindscape by Eleneth, Hollow Flame's powerful sister, who reveals his identity as the true noble heir and tries to recruit him, an offer he politely refuses.
‚Ä¢ Chapter 11 (The Offer): Adrian and Lily reveal their noble status, welcome Zachor into their family, and offer to sponsor his enrollment in the prestigious Noble Academy of Kings, a chance for him to realize his dream and change his fate.

also give names for the stages/choices, as it gets saved in supabase and it really helps in saving the players data

make rolls in fight/combat, e.g if you fight a goblin then give options like, pucnh is fro strenght, kick is for agility, and dodge is for luck, and then give the rolls, e.g if you punch a goblin, then the roll is 1d20 + strength, and if you kick a goblin, then the roll is 1d20 + agility, and if the player dodges, then the roll is 1d20 + luck

make it so that the players stats are helpful (e.g if they have a lot of luck, they can find treasure with a lot of character_points)

Make sure to include the following:
- SCENE: [description]
- CHOICE1: [choice] (Strength-based)
- CHOICE2: [choice] (Luck-based)
- CHOICE3: [choice] (Agility-based)

also make a \n with in between choices and the scene, so that it is easy to read

and never say "You encounter something mysterious in the forest..." its annoying, make it so that it is unique and interesting, e.g "You stumble upon a hidden cave, the air inside is thick with dust and the smell of ancient magic, the walls are lined with glowing runes that seem to pulse with an otherworldly energy, the cave is filled with the sounds of distant whispers and the occasional rustle of unseen creatures, you can feel the weight of history pressing down on you as you take your first steps into the cave, the air grows colder and the runes seem to glow brighter, you can't shake the feeling that you are not alone in this place" like creative, also as said before use the \n to make it easy to read

Also make there be be lore and history in the encounters, e.g "You stumble upon a hidden cave, the air inside is thick with dust and the smell of ancient magic, the walls are lined with glowing runes that seem to pulse with an otherworldly energy" also there should be battles every few times, like goblins, orcs, undead knights or the hordes

If the player has a high luck stat, and he chooses to explore, make there be a chance for him getting a secret quest, like a chest or a map he needs to find, and if he has a high agility stat, make there be a chance for him to escape from a battle, and if he has a high strength stat, make there be a chance for him to win a battle, and if he has low strenght stats, make there be a chance for him to lose a battle, and if he has low agility stats, make there be a chance for him to get caught in a battle, and if he has low luck stats, make there be a chance for him to miss out on a secret quest, like a chest or a map he needs to find. 

also make it so that the encounters are unique, and not repetitive, e.g if the player has already fought a goblin, then make it so that the next encounter is not a goblin, but something else, like an orc or an undead knight or the hordes.

and last but not least, DONT MAKE ANYTHING REPETETIVE, MAKE IT SO THAT THE PLAYER CAN HAVE A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE EVERY TIME THEY PLAY THE GAME AND NO TUTORIALS OR PLAYTHROUGHS CAN HELP THEM, MAKE IT SO THAT THEY HAVE TO PLAY THE GAME TO GET THE FULL EXPERIENCE
